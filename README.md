# WheelLogAndroid

This project aims to tailor original WheelLog for Android to be better suited for long-range EUC rides. Most important changes over original version:

1. Voice messages to keep track on your ride parameters, battery status etc. without constantly staring into your smartphone or smartwatch (if you have one).
2. Live map integration to record your ride and, optionally, share it with family, friends or anyone.
